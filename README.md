# Human-Robot-Interaction

In this project developed with an arduino uno kit in the Arduino IDE, I attempted to give emotions to a robot I made. I experimented with how to convey emotions through movement, sound and light. I asked a third-person to guess the emotions after sometime. I discoovered that some basic emotions such as angry, sad, friendly and happy where easy to convey with movement, sound and light.
